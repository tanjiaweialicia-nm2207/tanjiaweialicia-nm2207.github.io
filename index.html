            <p>Also, please refer to the Word Doc for my diary entry as well, I know it was stated in the
            instructions to put it on the webpage but my diary entry has a lot of photos in it!

            <p>I will be using the front portion of the webpage to elaborate more on the nature of sexual
                assault in Singapore, almost like a mini-essay. Sorry it's not out yet, I'll need some time
                to work on it! Just like the rest of my webpage :'D
            </p>
            <p>Here's my <a href="resources/interimProjectSubmission.docx">Word document</a> detailing what 
                I have learnt along with diary entry recordings</p>

            <p>Over here I will be adding in some insights and personal thoughts on sexual assault using
                the document.getElementById function in my Javascript. So when I click on the button on the
                left not only will it show the chart with relevant data but also some personal insights.</p>
