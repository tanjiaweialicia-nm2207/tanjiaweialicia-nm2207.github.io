        <h1>Sexual Assault in Singapore</h1>
        <h2>Research question: How many cases of sexual assault do we see in Singapore yearly?</h2>
        <img class="assaultedGirl" src="resources/istockphoto-507801456-612x612.jpg"><h6>Image of a depressed girl after getting sexually assaulted</h6></a>
        <p>This is a question that has always been on my mind. Sexual assault is one of those things within our conservative Singaporean society that
          we are aware of its existence but we don't talk more about. Between 2017 and 2020 alone, 
          <a href="https://www.police.gov.sg/media-room/news/20220412_police_sexual_assault_awareness_seminar_2022"> 9200 reports of 
            sexual assault </a> were 
          made, including rape, sexual assault by penetration, outrage of modesty, and sexual offences involving children and vulnerable victims.
          However, only a select few cases are prosecuted every year. The nature of sexual assault makes many victims scared to report the crime
          that happened to them. Many factors like the fear of victim blaming, the intimate nature of sexual assault and/or familiarity with
          the perpetrator may inhibit a victim's deicison to report the incident. Here, I explore how many reports of sexual assault have
          been made in the past few years using available datasets, the nature of these reports, and what can be done in the future to
          encourage individuals to open up and report their cases so they can seek legal justice against their perpetrators.

      <h3>Overview of Sexual Assault in Singapore</h3>
      <p>In this chart, I map out the number of reports made for sexual assault as a whole in Singapore. This included statistics derived
        from the Ministry of Social and Family Development website on <a href="https://www.msf.gov.sg/research-data/research-reports-data/support-families-and-parents/article/Violence-Rape-Victims">
          rape</a> and <a href="https://www.msf.gov.sg/research-data/research-reports-data/support-families-and-parents/article/Violence-Outrage-of-Modesty-Victims">
          outrage of modesty</a> cases in Singapore. These statistics may not be a reflection of the severity of sexual assault as a
          problem within Singapore, as many victims often do not report the crimes that have happened to them.</p>
